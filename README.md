# Module-15-Roboadvisors-Challenge

In this module, Iâ€™ll combine all my machine learning skills with conversational user interfaces (CUIs) and cloud services.

Using the power of machine learning and NLP to disrupt finance and improve the customer experience, I am creating a robo advisor. Both existing and potentially new customers will be able to use this robo advisor to get investment portfolio recommendations for retirement.

##

* Configure the initial robo advisor
* Build and test the robo advisor
* Enhance the robo advisor with an Amazon Lambda function
  * Create an Amazon Lambda function that validates the user's input and returns the investment portfolio recommendation. This includes testing the Amazon Lambda function and integrating it with the bot.

## 
* Initiate the bot
* Create the intent
* Create Lambda
* Test Lambda
* Deploy Lambda
